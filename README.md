# Innovation Algebra for ChatGPT

> "Innovation Algebra (IA) is like a Swiss Army knife for knowledge processing and innovation; it's a versatile tool that brings structure and clarity to the complex world of ideas, helping innovators and thinkers to systematically navigate and cultivate the landscape of possibilities."

Innovation Algebra (IA) is an experimental framework designed for systematic generation, processing and evaluation of ideas. What sets IA apart is its integration within ChatGPT, allowing users to leverage the natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT in combination with the structured functions of IA.

With a defined set of functions, IA facilitates the retrieval, analysis, and synthesis of knowledge across various domains. Function pipelining, a key feature of IA, allows for the sequential chaining of functions, streamlining complex multi-step tasks such as combining knowledge from different fields, identifying the forefront of research, and generating profound insights.

For example, a researcher exploring the intersection between Quantum Physics and Molecular Biology can use IA within ChatGPT to efficiently map the knowledge frontier, synthesize findings, and generate new insights. This fusion of IA's structured approach with ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities creates a powerful tool for knowledge-intensive endeavors.

Innovation Algebra operating within ChatGPT offers a blend of structure and flexibility, making it an invaluable asset for entepreneurs, researchers, academics, and professionals seeking to navigate and harness the depth and breadth of knowledge. It is a great model to structure your thinking.

## Case Studies

Innovating and solving real problems is .. **complex**. 

IA aspires to solve real-world problems using AI. Hence IA is more complex than the typical ChatGPT prompt. Plus IA uses frameworks that you probably never heard of before. 

The best way to get a feeling for how IA can be used is the case studies. Recent case studies are at the top of each list. Note that new case studies are re-formattings of ChatGPT logs with the long IA prompt removed for readability.

### Creativity Tests / Innovation Hero persona

* [NeuroPet/TalkToThem](casestudies/TalkToThem.md) - Capability test of IA ability to develop ideas 'from zero' and optimize them. Creates a product in the human/animal communication space, also covers ethics of using IA in innovation.
* [Time Toaster](casestudies/time-toaster.md) - Capability test of IA ability to develop ideas 'from zero' and optimize them. Creates a time-traveling toaster.

Please reach out to add yours to the list.

## The ChatGPT Prompt

* Here is the current [ChatGPT prompt](/ia-gpt-4.md) (latest version 2.7).
* IA 2.6+ is powerful enough to evolve itself and make suggestions for its own improvement. For example, IA 2.7 was mostly designed with the help of IA 2.6. If you discover that your problem is too complicated for IA, I suggest that you ask it to design additional functions and frameworks, which you can immediately use. Please share your IA discoveries so that other innovators and researchers can also benefit.
* The complexity of IA now has out-grown GPT 3.5, and my work is now just focusing on GPT 4. I know it leaves a lot of folks behind, so effort to make it work on GPT 3.5 is appreciated.
* You will likely run into usage limits of GPT-4 since IA tends to create long and interesting sessions. Currently there is no work-around for this.

## Guru Mode (IA 2.5+)

Since innovation frameworks are complex, IA 2.5 introduces "Guru mode" to guide your exploration. Set your Goal() and invoke Guru mode via ++. Guru will pick IA functions and frameworks to guide you to your goal. 

[View Example](https://chat.openai.com/share/252ce844-d929-4b5b-b6c3-abf0dc682725).

* IA 2.7 introduces the Mentor, which observes the IA sessions. You can ask it for feedback, but in general it just observes. See the case study on light pollution below.


🧠 ++ 🤖


## Tips

* Needless to say, you need to have a basic knowledge of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and what a prompt is.
* Read a few case studies, even if the topic does not interest you.
* Beginners can safely ignore Innovation Algebra output that looks like scary code.
* You don't need to use the IA functions exactly as defined. You can also just type your request. 
* You can do a lot by setting a goal, and invoking the Guru to guide you.
* If you don't know what to do next, type `++` to invoke the Guru. It will guide you.
* You can do a lot with the core functions KF, RD, Q, and Essay. Learn them.
* My suggestion is to keep a list of the frameworks handy (see below). Try the frameworks and see what they do. You don't need to be an expert to use them.
* IA conversations can get very long, very quickly. At some point, ChatGPT runs out of 'memory', and its IQ drops like 50 points. 
* I highly recommend ChatGPT Plus (paid) using GPT 4. As of 6/14/2023, Chat GPT 3.5 (turbo) has problems following IA's complicated logic.
