# Case Studies

Innovating and solving real problems is .. **complex**. 

IA aspires to solve real-world problems using AI. Hence IA is more complex than the typical ChatGPT prompt. Plus IA uses frameworks that you probably never heard of before. 

The best way to get a feeling for how IA can be used is the case studies. Recent case studies are at the top of each list. Note that new case studies are re-formattings of ChatGPT logs with the long IA prompt removed for readability.

### Creativity Tests / Innovation Hero persona
